    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Fried rice, the dish that can be conjured up from almost any
        ingredients from your fridge. The only you really need to make 
        fried rice is, rice. Just splash some oil, eggs, rice, and anything
        else that you like. Soy sauce is very popular in fried rice, but
        you can also just use salt or any other seasonings you enjoy. Fried
        rice really is a plain canvas, waiting for you to create your own
        version of art.
